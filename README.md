# Sheep Rescue Game
In this repo you can find the project for the **game Sheep Rescue**, created by following:
- [Introduction to Unity Scripting - Part 1](https://www.kodeco.com/4180726-introduction-to-unity-scripting-part-1)
- [Introduction to Unity Scripting â€“ Part 2](https://www.kodeco.com/4180875-introduction-to-unity-scripting-part-2)

All steps in both parts have been done.

You can also find an **executable** for the game in SaveSheepExecutable.zip.

_Disclaimer: The executable works before and after compressing it but it says it is damaged after I download it from GitHub._

_I have not been able to fix it. I have uploaded a screen recording to the repo showing the issue._
